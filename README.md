# Toggl â†’ JIRA worklogs

Time tracking in JIRA sucks for various reasons and I'm quite used to Toggl.
But manually filling worklogs in JIRA can be irritating (considering how slow JIRA is).
I prepared script to address those issues and sync Toggl time entries directly to JIRA worklogs.

## What do I have to do?

Deploy this app on Heroku.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/fmasa/toggl-jira/tree/master)

or host the app yourself (PHP 7.1+ and cURL required).

## How can I configure the app?
You can use environment variables to configure app with your Toggl and JIRA credentials (Heroku will ask you for those).

### Environment variables:

- **JIRA_HOST** - JIRA host for your organization (including https://).
- **JIRA_USERNAME** - Your JIRA username.
- **JIRA_PASSWORD** - Your JIRA password.
- **SECURITY_TOKEN** - Token used for app authorization.
- **TOGGL_CLIENT_ID** - Your client ID in Toggl.
- **TOGGL_TOKEN** - Your auth token for Toggl.
- **ERROR_WEBHOOK** (optional) - URL to be called on error.

## How can I sync those entries to JIRA?
Because Toggl can be used for more than just work, every entry you wan't to sync must have **JIRA** tag, name beginning with issue key
and (any) project associated.

Now just call the app: *https://{app_location}?token={SECURITY_TOKEN}* and your time entries will be synced.

If you wan't to automate syncing even more take a look at [IFTT Maker](https://ifttt.com/maker).
